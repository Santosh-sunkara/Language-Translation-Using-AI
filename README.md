Language Translation Using AI 🌐🤖
Overview
This project implements a machine learning-based language translation model using a sequence-to-sequence architecture with an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network. It is designed to translate French text into English 🇫🇷➡️🇬🇧 by learning from a dataset of French-English sentence pairs.

Technologies Used 🛠️
Python 🐍
TensorFlow/Keras 🤖
NumPy 🔢
Pandas 📊
Matplotlib 📈
Seaborn 🌺
Dataset 📄
The project uses a dataset of French and English sentences stored in a text file (fra.txt). Each line in the file contains a pair of sentences: the first is in French, and the second is in English. The sentences are tab-separated, with the target sentence (English) enclosed by special start (\t) and end (\n) tokens.

Model Architecture 🧠
The translation model is based on the sequence-to-sequence architecture, which consists of:

Encoder: Uses LSTM to process input sequences (French sentences).
Decoder: Uses another LSTM to generate output sequences (English translations).
Dense Layer: Softmax activation to predict the next word in the sequence.
The training process involves mapping input text (French) to output text (English) using one-hot encoding for each token.

Parameters ⚙️

Epoch 1/100
63/63 [==============================] - 52s 687ms/step - loss: 1.6330 - accuracy: 0.7117 - val_loss: 1.2549 - val_accuracy: 0.6835
Epoch 2/100
63/63 [==============================] - 42s 670ms/step - loss: 1.0374 - accuracy: 0.7277 - val_loss: 1.0833 - val_accuracy: 0.6996
Model Training Performance 📈
After training, the model achieves improved accuracy in translating French sentences into English over the course of the epochs, reaching validation accuracy above 83%.

Future Improvements 🔮
Experiment with different neural network architectures, such as Transformer or GRU-based models.
Use a larger dataset to improve the model's performance.
Implement interactive translation features.
